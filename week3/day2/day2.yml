Today Agenda:
09:30 to 10:30  : Collection-SET
10:30 to 11:00  : BreakOut+Break
11:00 to 12:15  : LearnConstructor, keywords-this,Super
12:15 to 12:35  : Breakout 




List:
{2,5,4,6,2,7,8,1,6}
get(4)=>2
index value get()

SET:
input :{2,5,4,6,2,7,8,1,6}

output : {2,5,4,6,7,8,1} 
get(4)=>7

index value change so we cannot use get()


Collection: Set
Definition:
The Set interface in Java is a part of the Java Collections Framework.
It represents a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
Properties of Set:
No Duplicate Elements: Ensures that each element in the Set is unique.
Unordered Collection: Except for some specific implementations like LinkedHashSet or TreeSet, the Set does not guarantee the order of its elements.
Implementation Classes:
HashSet:
Maintains a random order
LinkedHashSet:
Maintains insertion order of elements.
TreeSet:
Ascii value
Maintains sorted order


collections.sort()=> sameFunction in SET we can get from TreeSET
Why There is No get() in Set:
The Set interface does not have a get() method, and this is by design, due to the following reasons:

Uniqueness Over Indexing: The Set is designed to ensure uniqueness rather than maintain an index-based system like List. Elements in a Set are not accessed by an index.
Undefined Ordering: In most implementations of Set, the order of elements is not fixed. Therefore, retrieving an element by a specific index or position does not make sense.
