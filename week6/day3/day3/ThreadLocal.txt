public  - we can access from anywhere of this project
private - we can able to access only with in a class
protected - we can able to same packages, if i want to acess different
            but class should be inherited
default   - only with in a packages


getter() --> to get the data from private variables
setter() --> we can able to make some changes 

Steps to implement thread Local:
Pre-Step: Remove the constructor call from the all the pages

1.Declare the driver as ThreadLocal Instancr in BaseClass
private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> remoteWebDriver=new ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver>();
2. create setter(setDriver)method to set the value for ThreadLocal driver instance value
3.create a getter(getDriver)  method to get ThreadLocal driver instance value
4.Call the setDriver() from preCondition --@BeforeMethod annotation
5.Replace all the driver as getDriver() in the BaseClass and Pages




Properties File:
1.used to keep the static data for project-- url, username, password
2.Java having some predefinied libraries --> class and method  to interact with property file
