What is Java?
 *Java is a programming language used to create software applications, including web and mobile apps.
 *Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it organizes code into reusable components
  called objects. 
 Objects can contain both data(variable) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.
 *Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making them portable.
 *Code written in Java can be run on different devices without modification.
 * Java has a large and active community of developers worldwide.


Java Architecture:

 JVM: Java Virtual Machine
 JRE: Java Runtime Environment
 JDK:Java Development Kit

JVM is the virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.
JRE is the runtime environment that includes the JVM and libraries needed to run Java applications.
JDK is the development kit that includes the JRE along with development tools for writing, compiling, and running Java programs.



IDE: Integrated Development Environment
Definition: An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is like a digital workspace where programmers write, edit, and
 manage their code. It provides tools such as a code editor, debugger, and compiler, all in one place,
  making it easier for developers to create and maintain their software.

To Create New Project :
===================
Step 1 -  MouseHover on File & Click File
Step 2 - MouseHover on New --> Click Project.
Step 3 -  under Maven folder --> Click Maven Project & click Next Button.
Step 4 - click 'create a simple project' checkbox✅ & click Next Button.
Step 5 - Enter 'Group id' & 'Artifact id' and click Finish Button

To Create Package :
================
Step 1 - Right Click on src/main/Java --> New --> click package
Step 2 - Enter week1.day1 (Name start's with lowerCase) in Name field  and click Finish Button.

 
 To Create Class :
================
Step 1 - Right Click on week1.day1 package --> New --> click Class
Step 2 - Enter HelloTestLeaf  (Name start's with UpperCase) in Name field.  
Step 3 - click 'public static void main(String[] args)' checkbox ✅
Step 4 - Then, click Finish Button.

********************************************************************************************************************************************
  @Package:
  Packages help in organizing large codebases, improving code readability, and 
   better maintenance and collaboration.

   *NamingConvertion: package name should start with "lowercase"
   Ex: week1

 @Class:
    A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in object-oriented programming (OOP). 
    It defines the data (variable) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.

   *NamingConvertion: package name should start with "uppercase" and "PaselCase"
   Ex: Browser,BrowserType

  @Variables:
   A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value. 
   In programming, variables are used to store and manipulate data.

   *NamingConvertion: package name should start with "lowercase" and CamalCase
   Ex:classRoom


  @DataTypes:
   In programming, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold.
   It defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data,
   and the way values of that type can be stored
